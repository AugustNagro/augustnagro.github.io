A showcase of evolution's diversity. Inspired by Mr. Traina's Evolution, Biodiversity, and Ecology (EBE) class at the Illinois Math and Science Academy.

The site implements Google's <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> project, although it breaks with specification in a few places. Service workers are used to provide offline caching, which in in concert with the manifiest.json, allows native-like functionality on mobile. Because it meets the following <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/app-install-banners/web-app-install-banners?hl=en">criteria</a>, Chrome will prompt mobile users to add the app to their homescreen, where it functions similarly to an <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> app.

I hope to add creatures often.
